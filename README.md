- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrmpls
- 👀 I’m interested in github because I use multiple devices and want a centralized repository.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and relearning javascript, HTML,CSS, JAVA, C# and possibly C++ and C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate my own work only for now
- 📫 How to reach me my email or stair at the sun and say "get me AZy" or when you are praying tell god that you want to contact me. God will deliver we are  roomates.
